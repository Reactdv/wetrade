Some of the countries to which your personal data may be transferred for these purposes that are located outside the EU do not benefit from an adequacy decision issued by the EU Commission regarding protection afforded to personal data in that country.

A copy may be requested at the address set out in the Contact Us section.

YOUR STATUTORY RIGHTS

You have certain rights concerning your Personal Data under DP Law as mentioned below, and can exercise them by contacting us at support@wetrade.one

Access: you are entitled to ask us if we are processing your information and, if we are, you can request access to your personal data. This enables you to receive a copy of the personal data we hold about you and certain other information about it to check that we are lawfully processing it. We process a large quantity of information, and can thus request, in accordance with DP Law, that before the information is delivered, you specify the information or processing activities to which your request relates.

Correction: you are entitled to request that any incomplete or inaccurate personal data we hold about you is corrected.

Erasure: you are entitled to ask us to delete or remove personal data in certain circumstances. There are also certain exceptions where we may refuse a request for erasure, for example, where the personal data is required for compliance with law or in connection with claims.

Restriction: you are entitled to ask us to suspend the processing of certain of your personal data about you, for example if you want us to establish its accuracy or the reason for processing it.

Transfer: you may request the transfer of certain of your personal data to another party.

Objection: where we are processing your personal data based on legitimate interests (or those of a third party) you may challenge this. However, we may be entitled to continue processing your information based on our legitimate interests or where this is relevant to legal claims. You also have the right to object where we are processing your personal data for direct marketing purposes.

Automated decisions: you may contest any automated decision made about you where this has a legal or similar significant effect and ask for it to be reconsidered.

SECURITY OF PERSONAL DATA

We use a variety of security measures to ensure the confidentiality of your Personal Data, and to protect your Personal Data from loss, theft, unauthorized access, misuse, alteration or destruction. These security measures include, but are not limited to:

● Password protected directories and databases;

● Secure Sockets Layered (SSL) technology to ensure that your information is fully encrypted and sent across the Intercom securely;

● PCI Scanning to actively protect our servers from hackers and other vulnerabilities.

All financially sensitive and/or credit information is transmitted via SSL technology and encrypted in our database. Only authorized WeTrade personnel are permitted access to your Personal Data, and these personnel are required to treat the information as highly confidential. The security measures will be reviewed regularly in light of new and relevant legal and technical developments.

We do not ask for financial or payment information, such as your credit card number, passcode, account number or pin number, in an e-mail, text or any other communication that we send to you. Please always check that any application on which you are asked for financial or payment information in relation to our reservations or services is operated by WeTrade. If you do receive a suspicious request, do not provide your information and report it by contacting one of our member service representatives as set out in this Privacy Policy.

You are responsible for keeping your account passcode, membership numbers and pin numbers safe and secure. Do not share those with anyone. If there is an unauthorized use or any other breach of security involving your information, you must notify us below as soon as possible.

RETENTION OF PERSONAL DATA

We retain Personal Data for as long as necessary to fulfil purposes described in this Privacy Policy, subject to our own legal and regulatory obligations. The criteria we may use to determine the retention period for certain categories of data includes:

● How long you have been a WeTrade member;

● Whether there are contractual or legal obligations existing that require us to retain the data for a certain period of time;

● Whether there is any ongoing legal or financial claim that relates to your relationship with us;

● Whether any applicable law, statute, or regulation allows for a specific retention period; and

● What the expectation for retention was at the time the data was provided to us.

In accordance with our record keeping obligations, we will retain Account and other Personal Data for at least five years (and some up to ten years, as required by applicable law) after an Account is closed.
